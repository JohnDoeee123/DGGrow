# DGGrow - Interview Test

# Install instructions:
Clone the repository to a local folder:<br/>
git clone https://github.com/JohnDoeee123/DGGrow.git<br/>
cd DGGrow<br/>
Run "composer install"<br/>

If the environment is not set up correctly to run symfony 5, you can install a premade docker box:<br/>
https://github.com/coloso/symfony-docker<br/>

After following the instructions,  map your symfony root folder to /var/www on the remote machine. You can do this<br/>
by editing the docker-compose.yml file
